# Steemit Viewer

This is a project I created due to poor performance of eSteem app for Android. It's based on NativeScript & Angular5. Currently it doesn't have much features but I plan to add more as time goes by.

Current features:
* Set ups your feed via username. No need to login, just provide account username and it will get feed from that.
* Infinite feed scrolling
* Post view (currently using HTML wrapper without much formatting - subject to change)
* App remembers your settings so no need to provide username every time
* Lightweight
* Trending page
* New page
* Hot page
* Blazing fast compared to eSteem app on my Xiaomi Mi5 with Android Oreo

Planned features:
* Trending Tags
* Ability to share links via native share panel
* Login support
* Push notifications with new posts from followed accounts
