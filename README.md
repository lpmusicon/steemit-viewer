# Steemit Viewer

This is a project I created due to poor performance of eSteem app for Android. It's based on NativeScript & Angular5. Currently it doesn't have much features but I plan to add more as time goes by.

Current features:
> Set ups your feed via username. No need to login, just provide account username and it will get feed from that.
> Infinite feed scrolling
> Post view (currently using HTML wrapper without much formatting - subject to change)
> App remembers your settings so no need to provide username every time
> Lightweight
> Blazing fast compared to eSteem app on my Xiaomi Mi5 with Android Oreo

Planned features:
> Trending page
> New page
> Hot page
> Trending Tags
> Ability to share links via native share panel
> Login support *this one is not so important for me right now as I try to get app working and I don't have much knowledge about steem api*
> Push notifications with new posts from followed accounts
